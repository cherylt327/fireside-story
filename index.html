        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...a fairy was caught in the storm.
        She was scared and cold.    
        The dark fairy was chasing her in the gloomy woods.
        She had to get the light from the valley fairies to keep the forrest in darkness.
        The dark fairy wanted to prevent her from reaching the light.
